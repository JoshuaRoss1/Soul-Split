====================
	Main Changes
====================
- Took code from Player.cs and separated it into separate scripts. I did this for ease of reading and so the code isn't all 
  bunched up in one script.
- New scripts that were made are:
	o PlayerMovement.cs (Assets/Scripts/Player)
		- Contains script for player movement -> Jumping, moving etc.
	o SoulSpawning.cs (Assets/Scripts/Player)
		- Contains script for spawning the different types of souls (Shifting, Still and Projected)
- Keybinds can now be changed in the inspector of the player prefab
	o I changed the keybind of the projected soul to the same as the still soul on the spot (Since both souls have very similar properties) --> Bound to 'E' for now
	  but can be changed ^^
	o Shifting souls are still spawned using 'Q'
- Since I have grouped Still and Projection together under the same keybind now, I swapped the buffer timer to the still soul instead of the shifting soul

========================================
	Other Changes and Planned Changes
========================================
- Created prefabs for different types of souls so their properties can be manipulated individually (Will help later on with interactions and stuff)
- Player movement needs to be re-tweaked
- Soul.cs is still the same and hasn't been touched (Although I am thinking of doing the same to this script as I did for Player.cs)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random Stuff:


Clean up code
-	Have another look at shifting souls
o	Do we really need a timer for the same keybind? <- to swap to still souls?
o	Can we have still souls and projection grouped together instead

Prefab for different types of souls
