** *THE BELOW OUTLINES PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. FEEL FREE TO IGNORE* **

**Description:** 
This project was the formulation of my original idea to create a complex 2D platformer that heavily focused on gameplay programming. Soul Split takes 2D platforming and combines it with puzzles and reaction based mechanics to keep the player on their toes. The main focus for this project for me was to take a difficult concept at my level of experience and produce something playable within the 12 weeks of development time that we were given.

**Challenges Faced:** Throughout the development process there were many challenges that were faced regarding my core contribution of the project, however these are the 3 major challenges that I believe highlight my skills as a gameplay programmer:
- **Making 2D platforming feel "right":** It was a major challenge to create a smooth 2D platforming feeling without hindering the core mechanics and features of the game. To overcome this challenge, I consulted various sources such as stackoverflow forums and youtube content to gain different perspectives on how to program certain movement features (Specifically "Hang Time" for jumping and jump weight).
- **Unity's new Input System:** This was a very difficult challenge to get around since I had previously only used Unity's old input system. Figuring out how to implement this new system took quite a while, however I managed to get a hold of it by consulting Unity's Input System documentation along with external research and code analysis. (A big part of this was figuring out how to get dynamic keybinds working, which turned out to be successful in the end)
- **Programming mechanics that work well with one another:** This challenge was also difficult to create a game feel that felt natural. Combining mechanics such as the *Soul Projection* and the *Soul Swap* is a heavily used feature throughout the levels. To get these mechanics to work well together required research into multiple areas such as control input mapping (to make the controls feel natural) and collision detections regarding position changes etc.

**Positions within Team:**
-  Positions: Lead Designer (Levels, Gameplay etc.)
-  Lead Programmer (Code Structure, Code Refactoring, Code Writing etc.)
-  Team Manager (Responsible for organising and holding weekly sprint and scrum meetings)
-  Deadline Manager (Made sure all team members were completing required tasks on time and to a standard that was acceptable)

**Contributions:**
-  Created the idea for the game (Full marks for elavator pitch, 90% for full pitch)
-  Gamplay Programming (Wrote a lot of the code within the game mainly focusing on soul mechanics, player movement, level transitions, collision detections and a lot more)
-  Level Design (Designed all levels and puzzles)
-  Documentation writing (Wrote and managed the majority of documentation for this project)
